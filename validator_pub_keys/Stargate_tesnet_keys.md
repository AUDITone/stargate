# Stargate Testnet with Gaia

## What are we trying to do?
We plan to snapshot the Hub validator state and do a simulated upgrade within the next 2 weeks. This upgrade will run an integration target of the Stargate stack. This will be similar to the testnet. You can run your production keys. If we do not see a key from you, we will replace your consensus key on the network with one of our own to ensure the testnet has adequate liveness.


## What do you need to do?
We need your current **"operator_address"** and and your **"consensus_pubkey"** in our pull request. We will be using these kyes to generate a genesis file for the upcoming Stargate Testnets. Simply complete the form to enter your data here: [Validator Key Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfkATe-KSwFa_Sc9EvpWBYwMmtB_LBXTOsNEH5eTjnJItT9Kw/viewform?usp=sf_link) Alternatively, you may make pull request on this repository with a JSON file of your key entry.
