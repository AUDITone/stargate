If youâ€™re running a block explorer, wallet, exchange, validator, or any other service (eg. custody provider) that depends upon the Cosmos Hub or Cosmos ecosystem, youâ€™ll want to pay attention, because this upgrade will involve substantial changes.

## Testnet

We've launched the first public alpha testnet for the Stargate Upgrade on Tuesday August 25th.

This testnet is intended for:

* Testing wallets, exchanges and block explorers against the legacy Amino REST interface
* Giving node operators and validators an opportunity to test their integrations against a work in progress version
* Playing with new Stargate features including IBC but real testing of IBC will wait on Akash updating the Relayer and possibly a future testnet.

We anticpate restarting this testnet with future integration targets. Once we have a migration script, we will launch a testnet with a simulated upgrade from cosmoshub-3.

Our validator node for a persistent peer is available at

``` bash
00d8e9c0df367296436854b580d9b069d3f1a5fd@35.223.139.159:26656
```

As of 08/31/2020, the tagged `gaia` version is [stargate-1a](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases/tag/stargate-1a)

Remember this version now has a single binary instead of `gaiacli/gaiad` and much more configurable `app.toml`

``` bash
git checkout https://github.com/cosmos/gaia
git checkout stargate-1
make build
```

The genesis file is available [here](genesis.json)
