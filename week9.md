# Stargate Week 9 September 9th

## Executive Summary

Big week for the Stargate initiative with the launch of the first `stargate-1` testnet.

This testnet has been humming along nicely for last week. We've seen both **Akash** and **Agoric** projects adopt the stargate codebase for forth coming release. Blockscape, Everstake and IRIS have joined Iqlusion in running `stargate-1` validators. Jack and the `Akash` team are hard at work updating the IBC relayer to run on the testnet.

We've encountered, documented and worked with the SDK and IBC team to fix a number of bugs encountered with running work-in-progress stargate code.

We are looking forward to stability and better documentation of the legacy amino interface before we start on boarding larger developer teams.
