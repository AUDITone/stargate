# Stargate Week 10 &11 September 16th

## Executive Summary

Condensing two weeks of updates into 1. It's been a busy week in addition to general end times vibe of 2020.

We started out with setback. The bug fix for legacy amino aimed aimed for `stargate-2` failed to fix the correct code path. 

Right now we have the `stargate-2` testnet with working state sync.(We aren't aware of any node operators successufully using state yet.)

Thing are looking up for `stargate-3`. IBC is very close to working fully wokring. A new fix for legacy amino transaction broadcast is in the works.

We expect that most integrations with Cosmos can be tested against `stargate-3` and we will be able to finally certify the existing ecosystem as Stargate ready.
